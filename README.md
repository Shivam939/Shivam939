# 👋 Hello, I'm SHIVAM TYAGI

### 🚀 Java Developer | Capgemini
With 2.7 years of experience in Backend development, I'm passionate about building efficient, high-quality applications!.
I primarily worked with **Java** and **Springboot** to develop Web Applications.

### 🌱 What I'm Learning
- **Prometheus and Grafana** - Open-source tools that work together to monitor and visualize applications and systems.
    Prometheus collects metrics, whule Grafana turns those metrics into dashboards and visualizations! 🎨
- **Modern Web Development** - Always on the lookout for tools to improve performance and user experience.

### 🛠️ My Tech Toolbox
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Java, JEE, Spring Boot, Hibernate, JPA , Spring Securirty, Docker, Git/GitHub.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, SQL & ORM (Hibernate JPA)

### 💡 My GitHub Projects

-  ### 🛒 Shopping Application - Java Spring Boot, Microservices, MySQL, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana

This is a simple **shopping application** built with **Java Spring Boot** using **microservices architecture**. 
It allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and checkout. 

- **Backend**: Microservices architecture with **Spring Boot** for product,order and Inventory services.
- **Database**: **MySQL** for persistent data storage.
- **Docker**: Containerized the application to ensure consistency across environments.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated **Prometheus** for metrics collection and **Grafana** for real-time monitoring and visualization.

You can explore the project to understand how I implemented microservices, managed inter-service communication, 
and used monitoring tools to keep the application efficient and reliable.
